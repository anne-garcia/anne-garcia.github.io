                <h3>Cassandra Thompson</h3>
                <p>
                    Just prior to my 42nd Birthday I took up a hobby (pole fitness) while I was on a sabbatical, that close friends call “midlife crisis”. Mine, however, didn’t turn into a new car, but new ‘car’eer. 
                    See, the thing is, I have a geeky science education, worked as a self-employed/entrepreneur in the finance industry for 17 years, have never been overly fit, or involved in any physical sports. 
                    Wife and Mother of two wonderful daughters, I’m certainly not the type of person you’d expect to find in the Sisterhood, and yet I am sooo typical. I’m one of the few that get such an adrenaline rush from being in a studio and around other polers that I even put up with my vertigo while I had to learn spins! People call me strong, but I look at all the great pole artists, aerial artists and I can only find fault in my imperfections and strive for more greatness. But I willingly admit to a strength of character to go after something I’m passionate about and try and make the world a better place by enthusiastically and genuinely trying to share it with others, 
                    so they can also experience or feel that same powerful connection to achievement, accomplishment, to unleashing and reconnecting with your sexy strong self. 
                    I am Loving every minute of this challenge.

                <h3>Laura Griffin</h3>
                <p>
                    Laura Griffin is the innovative founder of Griffin Aerial Arts. 
                    A professional performer since 2005, Laura has toured across Canada, the United States, Mediterranean, Philippines and Europe with companies like Illuminair Entertainment, Cirque Sublime and Disney Cruise Lines. 
                    She is a multidisciplinary professional circus artist coaching and performing over the past 15 years on aerial hoop, silks, Spanish web, mobile, net, straps, Chinese poles, dance trapeze, and partner balancing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking her passion for movement, Laura chose to seek an education in movement by studying dance through the Etobicoke School of the Arts and the Fine Arts (Dance) Department of York University. This afforded her the opportunity to study the science behind strength, flexibility and cognitive adaptation. 
                    Aerial arts blended the elements of dance and sport which she loved, developing a deep passion which burns strong in her heart. 
                    A passion she loves to share with students and colleagues

                    Serena has many years not only with pole, but circus training and silks. 
                    When she isn’t busy flying high, she has a Clark Kent alter ego professional life, and a loving family to keep her busy.
